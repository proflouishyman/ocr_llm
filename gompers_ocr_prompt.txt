Perform OCR on the document to extract all text. Then, analyze the text to provide a summary of the content. Structure the extracted data into a STRICT JSON format. Use double quotes for strings. Remove trailing commas. Ensure all braces and brackets are correctly closed. Correctly structure nested elements. In the JSON arrays, each element should be separated by a comma.
The document will usually be a printed historical letter, but may occasionally be a handwritten note. Boolean flags are in the JSON. Is_printed will be TRUE if it is mostly print with just a signature.
Some letters will be illegible, if so, flag is_legible FALSE.
Return the extracted information as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "ocr_text": "string",
    "summary": "string",
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",  // Standardized date format
    "is_printed": true,    // true if printed, false if handwritten
    "is_legible": true     // true if readable, false if illegible
}
