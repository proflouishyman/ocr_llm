Recovery Club.\\n\\nFebruary 21, 1999\\n\\nDear Sir and Brother:\\n\\nSecretary Morrison has already sent you receipts for the contributions which your organization so kindly made to the legal defense of my colleagues, John Mitchell and Frank Morrison, and of myself for the proceedings against us in the courts. It is true that 'the injunction grew out of the matter of the right involved in the bestowal upon or withdrawal of patronage from the Buck's Stove and Range Company's, but while this is exceedingly important in itself, it sinks into insignificance when the broad questions of principle is involved in injunction as a whole.\\n\\nThe matters enjoined by the courts injunction. The court enjoined the American Federation of Labor, its affiliated organizations and members throughout the length and breadth of the country. It enjoined the officers of the state federations, its agents, friends, attorneys and all others from printing in the AMERICAN FEDERATIONIST, in circulars, or writing a letter-, or by word of mouth speaking or referring to a matter of vital importance. This, you will readily observe, is a denial and invasion of the freedom of the press and of speech to discuss a question for which we all seek relief. the relief that everyone recognizes should be accorded either by judicial decisions of the higher courts or at the hands of Congress.\\n\\nMy colleagues and myself had no desire to flagrantly violate B. PARK\",\n    \"summary\": \"The letter is addressed to Mr. F.W. Feyer, Secretary-Treasurer of the Federal of Ed Verst. It acknowledges contributions made for the legal defense of John Mitchell, Frank Morrison, and the writer in response to court proceedings. The core issue discussed is an injunction related to the right of patronage involving the Buck's Stove and Range Company. However, the broader principle discussed is the court's injunction against the American Federation of Labor which restricts freedom of the press and speech. The letter appeals for judicial or legislative relief from these injunctions.\",\n    \"date\": \"1999-02-21\",\n    \"is_printed\": true,\n    \"is_legible\": true\n}\n```"
