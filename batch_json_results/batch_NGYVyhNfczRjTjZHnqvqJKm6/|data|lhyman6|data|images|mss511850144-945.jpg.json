In accordance with your suggestion I have submitted the matter to the Executive Council. Upon a decision being reached I shall advise you of the result.\\n\\nIn connection therewith I beg to remind you of the facts I enumerated in the conversation when you called me up over the long distance telephone yesterday. Very many of our affiliated organizations are in financial straits and have the greatest difficulty to maintain themselves. One of the large international unions, I have been authentically informed, by its President, has more than seventy per cent of its membership unemployed and this has been the fact for more than a year. That with this large number of unemployed, of course, not to the same extent in all organizations, and the effort of the organizations to be of some benefit to their unemployed men, together with the many trade disputes existing, I am very apprehensive as to both the substantial value of an assessment to your great membership, and the corresponding injurious influence and effect it may have upon many of the organizations.\",\n    \"summary\": \"The letter is addressed to Mr. John A.
