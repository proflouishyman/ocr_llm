Perkins, President,\\nCigar Makers\u2019 International Union,\\nMoion Building, Chicago, Illinois.\\nDear Sir and Brother:\\nYour favor of the 4th instant to hand and contents noted. I am glad you talked the matter over with Mr. Pifford relative to the Union Label Digest. At present it is impossible for me to say whether I can make Chicago for March first, and yet I may be able to do so. I take it for granted that you will be one of the delegates of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union to attend the union label conference to be held in this city beginning the morning of March third.\\nIn view of the fact that the inauguration of the President elect will take place on March 4th, you can readily understand that traffic from all over the country toward Washington will be to the fullest limit of the capacity of the roads, and I would therefore suggest that as soon as possible after reading this, you make reservation for the train leaving Chicago early on the morning of March 2d. It might be well to make the reservation for me so that we can both have lower berths. I think there is a train leaving Chicago early in the morning over one of the roads due here about eight o\u2019clock. I want to be here in time for the opening of the conference. If I go to Chicago, I will then accompany you on the train in returning here.\",\n    \"summary\": \"A letter dated February 10, 1909, addressed to Mr. G. W. Perkins, President of the Cigar Makers\u2019 International Union. The writer acknowledges receiving a message from Perkins and discussing the Union Label Digest with Mr. Pifford. The writer is unsure if they can travel to Chicago by March 1st but assumes Perkins will attend the union label conference starting on March 3rd. Due to the anticipated traffic for the President-elect's inauguration on March 4th, early reservations are suggested. They discuss travel plans and the possibility of sharing a lower berth on a train leaving Chicago on March 2nd.\",\n    \"date\": \"1909-02-10\",\n    \"is_printed\": true,\n    \"is_legible\": true\n}\n```"
