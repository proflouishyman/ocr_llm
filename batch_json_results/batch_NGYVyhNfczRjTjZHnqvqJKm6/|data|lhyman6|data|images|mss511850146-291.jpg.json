For myself, I counted him as one of my best friends, and knowing so well how you regarded him, not only as one of your best friends personally, but also in an official capacity, I sympathized with you in your loss, a loss not only to you but to the organization and to the general labor movement.\\n\\nWith sincere regrets, believe me to be\\nAlways your friend,\\n\",\n    \"summary\": \"The letter acknowledges the personal and professional loss felt by Mr. Hayes due to Mr. Dunn's death.
