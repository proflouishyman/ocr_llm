For some ycars thcrc has bcen a Structural Trades Alliance composed of Bricklayers, Carpontors, Structural Iron Workerr, lod Carriers and Plumbers. This Alliance scems to bc a closo corporation cs other trades hare from time to time tried to bc ndmittcd but on caoh occasion hxre bcen rofused. Thie has bcen folt by thocc Unions and when tho Building Trades dopartment A. F. of L. nns institutcd it nas wolcomod as tho move which nas to unito all tho Building Trados in a solid body undcr tho guidanco of tho A. F. of L. but it scems thjo is not true. Undor the guidanco of the A. F. of L.\\nThe Organization Committee of the Central Labor Union endcarord to form a Council and sccured the assistance of the Lathers, Tile roofors, Sheet Metal Workors, Cloctrical Workors and Tile Layors and Holpers' Union issucd invitations to all tho othor trades and aftcr several months' dolay finally cont for a chartor. Thoy waitcd for somo time and finally James Kirby said he would come to Hartford shortly and would endeavot to fotm a Council with all the Building Tradee affiliated. He did come here but instead of calling upon Brother Taylor, who had dono the corresponding with him, ho surely found tho Local Trades Alliance officers and iron the last lettor to Taylor, I guess they have again laid the matter over indefinitely and again tided over tho dangcr of opaning thoar ooors to tho smalkcr uniono. President Kirby eaid ic his letter:\\n\",\n    \"summary\": \"The letter, dated April 5th, 1909 from an organizer in Hartford, Connecticut, addresses Samuel Gompers, President of the A.F. of L., expressing concerns about the exclusivity of the Structural Trades Alliance. The Alliance, composed of trades like bricklayers and carpenters, has refused membership to other trades, contrary to the inclusive intentions of the Building Trades department of the A.F. of L. Despite attempts by the Central Labor Union to form a Council and obtain a charter, their efforts have been delayed. James Kirby suggested forming a Council but has not taken action to include smaller unions.\",\n    \"date\": \"1909-04-05\",\n    \"is_printed\": true,\n    \"is_legible\": true\n}\n```"
