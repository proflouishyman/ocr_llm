One is the result of inspira-\\ntion and resentment, an outburst of indignation, while the other\\nis a calm, calculating process, the strategy or battle which leads\\nto victory.\\n\\nAsking you to convey to the assembled officers and dele-\\ngates my most fraternal greetings and heartfelt good wishes, with\\nthe assurance of my personal regard, I am,\\n\\nSincerely and fraternally yours,\\n\\nSamuel Gompers\\nPresident,\\nAmerican Federation of Labor.\",\n    \"summary\": \"The letter emphasizes the importance of unions establishing financial systems to protect workers through the payment of higher dues. It advocates for a strategic approach to labor movements that prioritize fair wages, better working conditions, and avoiding unnecessary strikes.
