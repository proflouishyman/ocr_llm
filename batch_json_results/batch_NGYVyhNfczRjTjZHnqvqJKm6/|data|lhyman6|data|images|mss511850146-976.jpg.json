The object of that artificer class\\n\\nis, as stated above, to take the poor workmen from civil life who\\n\\nwill enlist, and make a better workman of him for the purposes of\\nthe Navy afloat. The instruction given in no way interferes with\\ncivilian employees on the repair work of ships at Navy Yards, as the\\nmembers of the class are not utilized for this work. Moreover the\\nnumber in the class is strictly limited to the needs of the Fleet.\\nThe millions spent yearly upon repairs to ships at Navy Yards go\\n\\nto civilian employees, and there is no intention on the part of the\\n\\nDepartment to utilize classes under instruction upon such work.\\n\\nUndoubtedly this statement of the aims and practice of\\nthe artificer class will convince the President of the American\\ni\\n\\nFederation of Labor that no injustice is being done, to the Ameri-\\n\\n\\ncan civilian workman, and that he will appreciate the stand the Ameri-\\n\\ncan United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners has taken for\\n\\nthe safety of the American fleet imperatively demanding that on board\\n\\nan instruction of such craftsmen as will improve the technial\\nare incompetent to perform the duties which will devolve upon them\\n\\nRespectfully,\\n\\n(signed) G.
