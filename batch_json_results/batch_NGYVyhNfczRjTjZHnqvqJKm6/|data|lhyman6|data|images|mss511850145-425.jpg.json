U.\\n16 South Main St., Wilkes-Barre, Pa.\\n\\nDear Sir and Brother:\\nSecretary Morrison has already sent you receipt for the contribution which your organization so kindly made to the legal defense of my colleagues, John Mitchell and Frank Morrison, and of myself for the proceedings against us in the courts. It is true that the injury arose out of the matter of the right involved in the bestowal of the refusal of patronage from the Bucks Stove and Range Company. But while this is exceedingly important in itself, it sinks into insignificance when the broad question of principle is involved in the matters enjoined by the court's injunction. The court enjoined the American Federation of Labor, its affiliated organizations and members, throughout the length and breadth of the country; it enjoined the officers of the A. F. of L, its agents, friends, members, and all others from printing in the AMERICAN FEDERATIONIST, in circulars, or writing a letter, or by word of mouth speaking of, or referring to a matter of vital importance. This, you will readily observe, is a denial and invasion of the freedom of the press and of speech to discuss a question for which all seek relief, the relief which everyone recognizes should be accorded either by judicial decision of the higher courts or at the hands of Congress.\\nMy colleagues and myself had no desire to flagrantly violate\",\n    \"summary\": \"A letter dated February 20, 1909, addressed to Mr. Jos. R. Wilde, acknowledges receipt of a contribution towards legal defense. The writer discusses their legal proceedings related to the refusal of patronage from the Bucks Stove and Range Company. The letter expresses concern over a court injunction that affects the American Federation of Labor and its affiliates, seeing it as an infringement on freedom of the press and speech.\",\n    \"date\": \"1909-02-20\",\n    \"is_printed\": true,\n    \"is_legible\": true\n}\n```"
