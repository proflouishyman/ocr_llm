I do not understand purpose of threat.\\nLetter follows.\\n(Signed) SAMUEL GOMPERS.\\\"\\nAs I stated, it is difficult for me to see where my answer is indefinite, or what about it should induce you to state that unless a definite reply is received by December third, recommendation will be made definitely as to xxx action by the Council on 'Solicitors complaint.'\\nThe Newspaper Publishers Association protested against the charters being retained by the Newspaper Solicitors Union. Another protest was regarding proposed boycott which was to be levied against the San Francisco Call.
