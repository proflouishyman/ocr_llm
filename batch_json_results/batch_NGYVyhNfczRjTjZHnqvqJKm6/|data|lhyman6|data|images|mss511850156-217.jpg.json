This printing may be done by you, in which case it must be done in the form and manner prescribed by the rules of the court as to the type, size of page, and character of paper. If done by the clerk of the Circuit Court of Appeals he will charge for the printing alone 80\u00a2 per page for the first 30 copies, and 5\u00a2 additional for each 10 copies in excess of 30, that is to say he will charge 35\u00a2 per page for printing 40 copies, 90\u00a2 a page for 50 copies, and $1.00 per page for 60 copies, and to these figures will add his fee of 35\u00a2 per page, so that the fees charged by the clerk of the Circuit Court of Appeals vary from $1.00 to $1.20 per page according to the number of copies printed. Probably it will be necessary to have 60 copies.\\nAs to the number of pages in the printed record the rules provide parties or their counsel may agree in writing upon those portions of the record which are to be printed; subject to the authority of the court to direct other portions of the record that the court thinks necessary. If possible, Mr. Merritt and myself can agree to omit a considerable portion of the record which is in fact a series of repetitions.\",\n    \"summary\": \"This document outlines the costs associated with preparing the record on appeal, including certification and printing fees by the clerk of the circuit court. The costs vary depending on who prints the record and the number of copies required. Rules are provided for agreeing upon sections of the record to print, with provisions for omitting repetitive sections upon agreement.\",\n    \"date\": \"\",\n    \"is_printed\": true,\n    \"is_legible\": true\n}\n```"
