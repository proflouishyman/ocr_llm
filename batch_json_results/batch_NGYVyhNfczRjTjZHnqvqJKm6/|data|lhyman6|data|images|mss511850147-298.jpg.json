Y. \\n \\nMr. Samuel Gompers, President \\nAmerican Federation of Labor, \\n801 G. St. N. W. \\nWashington, D. C. \\n \\nDear Sir and Brother:- \\n \\nI am in receipt of your favor of March 30, \\nalso the copy of Organizer Roche's letter. I notice that Mr. Roche denies every statement that I made in my letter to you relative to Columbus matter. I received my information from Brother Ritzman, the representative of our Organization in Columbus, and I have received another letter from Brother Ritzman dated March 28th a copy of which I am enclosing you and which will explain itself. \\nI notice that Mr. Roche refers to me as having dreams. But I want to say that I have not got the time to dream that an organizer of the A. F. of L. has; I have to be out early and late in the interest of my organization, otherwise we could not be in a position to pay our per capita tax to help support Mr. Roche. I wonder if he will deny stating (which he did to me) that the action of the Denver Convention had obliterated the decision of the Minneapolis Convention as far as firemen were concerned. \\nNow, President Gompers you will see by Ritzman's letter of March 28th that Mr. Roche has taken sides in this fight in Columbus and a great wrong has been done to the organization that I represent, and my opinion it is now up to you to right matters and you can do so by writing to Mr. Louis Hostler, Pres. Columbus Brewers Assoc. and explaining to him how the A. F. of L. stand on this matter.\",\n    \"summary\": \"The letter is addressed to Mr. Samuel Gompers, President of the American Federation of Labor, and discusses a conflict involving Mr. Roche and Brother Ritzman concerning statements made about Columbus. The author refutes Roche's claims, provides additional information from Ritzman, and elaborates on the efforts and positions of the organization. The letter urges Gompers to address the matter by contacting Mr. Louis Hostler to clarify the stance of the American Federation of Labor.\",\n    \"date\": \"YYYY-MM-DD\",\n    \"is_printed\": true,\n    \"is_legible\": true\n}\n```"
