Experiment Design
Compare the training of LLMs for OCR with different levels of gold and silver quality data.

BART (100, 1000, 10000)
LLAVA (100, 1000, 10000)

The nomenclature is:
Bart, 100, Gold = bart_100_gold

TO DO
0. Batch submit sample to chatgpt. in the process extract information. doublecheck this hasnt been done before
1. Clean and organize the samples so that there are no handwriting examples
2. Double check consistent names with the previous OCR pytesseract data
3. Setup concurrent training systems for the different models with exhaustion epoch limits
4. Check results

OCR Images with Slurm
/data/lhyman6/OCR/scripts/ocr_slurm.sh

Preprocess the OCR Text
read_data.py        combines the ocr and original data, cleans up

Tokenize the Text
token_dist.py       tells you what the token size distribution is for the data. you need to know the max token size for different models
tokenize_data.py    turns the text into labelled tokens for training #i think i messed this step up. recheck.


Split data set

Training

/data/lhyman6/OCR/scripts/tune_bart.py
/data/lhyman6/OCR/scripts/tune_bart_slurm.sh

Testing
bart_test.py            #generates results
bart_test_validate.py   #uses validation tools

Process The OCR
run_bart_slurm.sh       #can be modified for many more GPUS but processes the OCR text


------ Running the data against the existing letters
OCR the images
/data/lhyman6/OCR/scripts/ocr_slurm.sh #current version does not check for existence.

Load results into csv file
/data/lhyman6/OCR/scripts/load_ocr_data.py #now checks for strings

Process The OCR
run_bart_slurm.sh     #currently set to /scratch4/lhyman6/OCR/work/tuning_results_robust/checkpoint-26440
/data/lhyman6/OCR/scripts/bart_over_data_modeltest_debug_1.py #current model. check for model list

---TESTING MODELS
/data/lhyman6/OCR/scripts/bart_over_data_modeltest_debug_1.py #runs a test batch for every model to compare results
