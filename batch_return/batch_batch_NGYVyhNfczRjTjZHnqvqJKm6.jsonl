There are innumerable instances among union where wages are regulated, hours are adopted and grievances adjusted without the loss of a penny or a moment of time through the organizations of the workers of the various crafts whose affairs are conducted in a business-like way. Such adjustments are not brought to the observance of the public through the press, because nothing of a sensational character presents itself in the arrangements. A number of the national organizations of the different trades have annual and biennial agreements with their employers for the adjustment of wages, hours, and other conditions of employment, whereby the probability of strikes is very much lessened, if not entirely avoided.\\n\\nIn the matter of wages the idea of the trade unions is to steady wages and establish a minimum scale for the weaker individual who would be crushed in the mill of opposition and bring down with him his own craft and all society eventually. There will be no permanency until the toiler secures the full product of his toil. This is the aim of labor.\\n\\nIn an educational way the trade unions have arrested the attention of all classes of society they have given the opportunity to men whose daily labor is to a large extent drudgery, to think and to act. The labor union is the poor man's college and university.\\n\\nIn a legislative way, through the efforts of organized labor, laws have been enacted to secure the safety of miners; for Sunday observance; mechanics' liens; liability laws; accident laws; safety coupler laws; regular payment; abolition of company stores; anti-oder-\",\n    \"summary\": \"This document discusses the benefits and objectives of the organization of labor, particularly stressing the role of the A.
